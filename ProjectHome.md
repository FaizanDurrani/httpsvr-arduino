# HTTP Server Library for Arduino Mega and Ethernet Shield #

`HttpSvr` is an HTTP Server Library for Arduino Mega and Ethernet Shield.

  * Supports GET and POST requests
  * Allows file upload and download
  * Serves AJAX requests
  * Serves static pages from SD card
  * User callback functions can be bound to URLs for dynamic content

The source code is rich of explanatory comments and can be used freely as a base for further developments.

`HttpSvr` has been developed from scratch trying to follow as closely as possible HTTP/1.1 specifications described in RFC 2616. Many specific citations of RFCs are made in comments in the sources, so as to allow quick reference.
